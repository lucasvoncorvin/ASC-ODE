# Examples

This section contains worked examples using the ASC-ODE library.

We will discuss several topics while dealing with the analysis of specific problems that can be modelled using ODEs and solving them numerically with different methods.
Such methods are usually obtained by integrating the ODE and using numerical integration on the given function $f(t,y(t))$.

The source code for all the examples can be found in the demos folder of the repository.
